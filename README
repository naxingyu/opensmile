About openSMILE:
================

openSMILE is a complete and open-source toolkit for audio analysis, 
processing and classification especially targeted at speech and 
music applications, e.g. automatic speech recognition, speaker identification,
emotion recognition, or beat tracking and chord detection.

The toolkit was first developed at the Institute for Human-Machine 
Communication at the Technische Universitaet Muenchen in Munich, Germany.
It was started within the SEMAINE EU-FP7 research project.
The toolkit is now owned and maintained 
by audEERING GmbH, who provide intelligent
audio analysis solutions, automatic speech emotion recognition,
and paralinguistic speech analysis software packages as well as
consulting and development services on these topics.

An open-source version for private use, education, and research
will always be available, next to commercial versions with
additional features (such as more interface components) or commercial
licenses for the open-source version.
